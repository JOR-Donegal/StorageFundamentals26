# Units

Just to completely confuse things, storage uses units that sound like SI units, but use the nearest Base 2 equivalent in increments of 10th powers. These have been standardized for some years now, but their use is patchy, even in my notes.

For example, 1KiB is 1024 bytes!

In 1986, the entire world had the capacity to store 2.6 EB of data. 

In 2008 I worked on a data centre plan to store data in the PB range. 

Its hard to get exact figures, but at time of writing, I am seeing estimates of 175ZB globally.
