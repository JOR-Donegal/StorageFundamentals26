We have always had a problem of scaling; things grow! 

In the past, as our needs expanded, we needed to replace systems we had grown out of; we called that _scaling up_ and the only people who liked the model were the salespeople who got to throw out your old investment every three years! 

A better idea is to _scale-out_; if you need twice the capacity, get a second device, and get the two devices to share the load, be it in capacity or input/output.  

I will almost always try to design systems around the concept of scale out.
